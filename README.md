### üìù Overview
Zelora is a fashion store API developed using Spring Boot, Spring Security, and Java. The API provides QR codes for different sections of the application, following HATEOS principles, and secures endpoints using JWT. The client application is built with ASP .NET Razor pages and utilizes the Singleton pattern to manage the JWT token across the client.
